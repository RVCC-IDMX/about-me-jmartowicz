**A SUMMARY OF MY ABOUT ME STEPS, WHICH OUTLINES THE TASKS I PERFORMED AND SKILLS I LEARNED TO COMPLETE THIS ASSIGNMENT**

The purpose of this project is to improve my skills and proficiency in HTML, CSS, and maybe even a little bit of javascript. Each skill I have learned has essentially gone in the order of what was learned in the course (IDMX 225) , as I was following the progression of each "about me" assignment. Each step is in alignment with this process. Most of the things I added were not from personal knowledge, therefore it is inferred that I learned each skill I performed while completing each task. My first steps were to set up my README.md, which I added my name, as well as instantiating my index.html file, building the core structure such as adding a page title, logo in my header, and adding two sections, first being my hero, second being my bio. 

My second step was to create my css file, in alignment with the "adding some style" assignment, which included setting the font and size of each heading tag, aligning the header, setting the style of the hero(including the background color, alignment, padding, border, and color), setting the size of the hero image, 
setting the style of the bio(which would be the background color, border, color, and alignment), as well as aligning the footer. 

My third step was to create a gallery and article as well as advancing my overall style within the css document.

        For my index.html file, I added a hobbies list which included an unordered list of six different hobbies, as well as three figures with hrs inbetween them. The particular images I added in these figures were copyrighted so I added in my own images later. Along with the figures I added each figcaption respectively. 
        I then added an article of 4 paragraphs of lorem ipsum, which at this moment I will be updating later with some sort of blog post.

        For my css file, I consolidated my hobbies, bio, hero and article into one design which included setting the background color, border, color, margin, box shadow, alignment, and border radius assignments. I then added unique assignments for my hobbies list(including width, margin, and alignment), my gallery (padding, margin, border, box shadow, background color, and text color), and my article(alignment, padding and h2 alignment). To compliment this, I tweaked the header and bio's margin, and my hero images border radius. 
        
My fourth step was to center my hobbies, add a 1st and 2nd media inclass dropcap and to replace the copyrighted images from my previous step with my own images.
      I added special css assignments to the first letter of each paragraph in my article, which included changing the font size, border, padding, float, margin, border radius, box shadow, and text shadow to create an effect around those letters. 
      I then added media states for a 960px and 100em width minimum. For my 960px minimum assignments, I changed my figure display to grid, and created grid template columns. For my figcaption, I changed the display to flex, justified the content and alignment of items to center, and changed my font size and margin. 
For the 100em asssignment, I changed the gallery to a grid display and added columns, as well as aligned the items to center. I then removed the hr, tweaked my gallery h2 grid settings, and changed my figure display to block. 
      I then made subtle changes to my main display settings such as cleaning up the gallery, and setting my hobbies to a flex display and a centered alignment.
My second commit for this step was to change my previous images to my own images. 

My fifth step was to fix the size of my gallery images, which was changing the max width to 100% to fix any issues, and to change my gallery h2 from a grid setting to a grid-column setting to fix any display issues at different sizes. 

My sixth step as to embed a video and to start creating a webform. For my video, I added a new section to my index.html document which included a h2, an iframe, and a list item to explain what the video was about. For my css, I made my video list item look like a caption which meant to change the list style type and padding, for my iframe I set my max-width to 90% to enchance the style at various sizes. I also set my overall video section style to that of each other section for better conformity to the page style. 

    I then started my contact form, which added name, email, phone, phone type, message,  reply, and radio inputs, as well as various style settings to my index.html file.
    
My seventh step was to continue work on my contact form, which included linking it to netlify, adding placeholders, and values to my radio inputs. I also added in a button. 

My eihgth step was my last step before the final project, and finished the contact form and completed the nav bar. This started with adding in all the style to my contact form, which included setting the contact padding, width and margin, for my fieldset I added a border and margin, for my legend I added a background color, text color, and padding setting, for my label I added a margin. For my input, text area, select and button I unified the padding, font size, font family, and margin assignments. I then set the color for the contact  ,phonetype, and placeholder, tweaked with my unordered list, and added a bunch of style to my button(including background color, text color, border radius, max width, justify-self, width, and font family.) For the main #formelements I changed the row gap, background color, border, text color and border radius. This finished my contact form.

    For the nav bar, I added html in my index.html which included changing my header to conform to the nav bar, which added a nav class nad a divclass with an image, h1, and an unordered list of links inside a div class. I then added a stylesheet for my nav, which changed my scroll behavior to smooth, body settings(box sizing, padding margn to 0), and main padding. For my navbar I set the background color, text color, display, flex direction, font size, and margin. For my logo, I changed the display to flex and aligned it to the center, changed its h1's font size, and tweaked the height and width of the image. 
For the navigation list, I removed the list style, set the display to block, and changed the padding. For my a tags in the header, I changed the color, background attachment, font size, padding, letter spacing, text decoration to none, and the display to inline block. For the hover function, I changed the color, background color, border radius and outline. For the media query, I changed the display of navbar-links and the unordered list for navbar to flex, with a justify-content of space-inbetween, and for the navbar as a whole I changed the flex-direction to row with space-inbetween.

THIS ENDS MY PRE-FINAL PROJECT ABOUT ME WORK

**OUTLINING MY COLOR SCHEME**

I designed my color scheme to be subtle and easy to look at, I think when conceiving a color scheme it may be hard to create good contrast without making it flashy, so I made the sublty of my contrast a priority.
